# hello-world
Hi everyone!

I'm Omal from Sri Lanka. I'm familiar with Java, Visual Basic and VB.net

I'm learning Android development and Python on my own. My profession is not related to programming at all, in fact I had to choose the current designation, because it "was" the best offer when I needed one. Now I feel like my brain is loosing its focus and creativity which I once had in programming, so I'm here to refresh my brain.

As I always believe, If you take care of your brain; your brain will take care of you!!! Same goes for cars!!! :)

So, thank you once again for taking your time to read this file up to here.

See you later.

Take care.
